/*
 * truehd_atmos.h - C API of the LibTrueHD decoder library.
 *
 * Decodes Dolby TrueHD (MLP FBA, and MLP FBB) bitstreams to planar float PCM, including the
 * Dolby Atmos object presentation (presentation 3) together with its object audio metadata
 * (OAMD): per-element kind, speaker, 3D position, gain, size and render flags, with
 * sample-accurate update timing. Built on the Rust `truehd` crate from
 * https://github.com/truehdd/truehdd (Apache-2.0).
 *
 * Model
 *   create -> [push bytes -> pull blocks until NEED_MORE_DATA]* -> destroy
 *   - push() accepts any chunking: whole demuxer packets (one or more access units each),
 *     partial access units, or arbitrary byte ranges of an elementary stream.
 *   - pull() decodes one access unit per call and returns it as one block.
 *   - reset() is for seeks: it drops all buffered input and decoder state; decoding resumes
 *     at the next major sync in the data pushed afterwards.
 *
 * Threading
 *   A decoder handle is not thread-safe: call it from one thread at a time. Separate handles
 *   are independent. No function blocks or performs I/O.
 *
 * Memory
 *   All pointers returned inside TrueHDAtmosBlock (channel planes, speakers, metadata and
 *   everything it points to) are owned by the decoder and stay valid until the next call to
 *   truehd_atmos_decoder_pull(), _reset(), _set_presentation() or _destroy() on the same
 *   handle. push(), get_stream_info(), get_stats() and last_error() do not invalidate them.
 *   Output buffers, metadata and bookkeeping are preallocated per handle. What pull() does
 *   allocate per access unit is the upstream `truehd` parser/decoder's working data (about 11
 *   allocations / 150 KB for a 16-channel access unit, 7 / 120 KB for 8 channels, freed again
 *   within the call) plus one copy of the access unit bytes (~0.5-1 KB) that its API takes.
 *
 * Errors
 *   Functions return TrueHDAtmosStatus. Damaged or undecodable input never makes pull() fail:
 *   the decoder drops data up to the next major sync, counts the event in
 *   TrueHDAtmosStats, records a message for truehd_atmos_decoder_last_error(), and flags the
 *   next block with TRUEHD_ATMOS_BLOCK_DISCONTINUITY. Rust panics never cross this API; if
 *   one is caught outside the per-access-unit recovery, the handle returns
 *   TRUEHD_ATMOS_ERR_PANIC until truehd_atmos_decoder_reset() or _destroy().

 *   y: 0 = front wall     .. 1 = back wall            (the screen is at y = 0)
 *   z: -1 = floor .. 0 = listener (ear-level) plane .. +1 = ceiling
 * Ear-level bed speakers sit at z = 0 and height speakers at z = 1; Atmos home content keeps
 * objects in z in [0, 1]. Values are clamped to x,y in [0,1], z in [-1,1] with the extended
 * precision refinement applied (resolution 1/310 in x,y and 1/75 in z).
 * Converting to the ADM / Dolby Atmos Master (DAMF) cartesian convention used by `truehdd`'s
 * .atmos.metadata files (x -1 left..+1 right, y +1 front..-1 back, z 0 ear..1 top):
 *   X = 2x - 1,  Y = 1 - 2y,  Z = z.
 * When TRUEHD_ATMOS_ELEMENT_SCREEN_REF is set, x and z are screen-anchored (0..1 across the
 * screen width, -1..1 over its height) and screen_factor/depth_factor say how much of the
 * screen reference to apply (TS 103 420 clause 5.2.1.3).
 *
 * Bed channels (kind BED/LFE) carry their nominal speaker position in the same coordinates
 * (LFE: 0,0,-1), their gain and ACTIVE flag; the other render fields are zero.
 *
 * TIMING: an OAMD payload arrives with an access unit (every 1536 samples = 32 ms in the
 * streams tested, i.e. every 38-39 access units at 48 kHz) and states one or more updates.
 * Update n starts at (access unit start + evo sample offset + sample_offset + 32 * block
 * offset factor(n)) per TS 103 420 clause 5.3, which can be in a later access unit than the
 * one that carried it. The decoder delivers each update in the block that contains its
 * start frame: TrueHDAtmosMetadataUpdate.frame_offset is always < TrueHDAtmosBlock.frame_count.
 * Rendering rule: at frame_offset, start a linear interpolation from each element's current
 * (possibly mid-ramp) values to the update's values over ramp_frames frames (0 = jump).
 * Elements without TRUEHD_ATMOS_ELEMENT_CHANGED in an update are unchanged; do not restart
 * their ramps (encoders periodically restate unchanged values with zero ramp).
 * Every OAMD payload is complete (no state carries over from earlier payloads), so the first
 * update after create/reset/DISCONTINUITY describes every element (all CHANGED): apply it as
 * a jump, there is nothing to ramp from. Blocks before it have no metadata
 * (TRUEHD_ATMOS_BLOCK_HAS_METADATA clear) - at most one payload interval, typically 32 ms -
 * during which object channels carry audio with no known position; mute or hold them.

 * SAMPLE RATE: blocks carry the stream's own rate (44.1 to 192 kHz); nothing is resampled and
 * a lossless stream cannot be decoded at a lower rate. Every presentation of a stream has the
 * same rate. Atmos (presentation 3) is 48 kHz in all content tested; should a 96 kHz Atmos
 * stream appear, its blocks report 96000 Hz / 80 frames per access unit and all OAMD timing
 * (frame_offset, ramp_frames) is in frames at that rate.
 *
 * INPUT TIMELINE: input_access_unit counts every access unit in the bytes pushed since
 * create()/reset(), in stream order, whether or not it was decoded: the ones skipped while
 * waiting for the first major sync, encoder duplicates, and ones that failed to decode all
 * count. input_frame_offset = input_access_unit * access_unit_frames is therefore the number
 * of input frames preceding this block's first frame. To place a block on the source
 * timeline after a seek: time = (pts of the first push after reset) +
 * input_frame_offset / sample_rate. This relies on the first push after create()/reset()
 * starting at an access unit boundary, which demuxed packets (MKV, MP4, M2TS/FFmpeg) always
 * do. Counting is per access unit, not per push: an access unit split across several pushes is
 * counted once, attributed to the push holding its first byte; a trailing incomplete access
 * unit is counted when it completes. The access units before the first major sync are found
 * by following their length fields back from it, so the count is exact; if the first push
 * starts mid-access-unit, that leading fragment (the tail of an access unit that began
 * before it) is not counted and the first whole access unit is number 0. Only when damaged
 * bytes had to be skipped (or more than 4 MiB arrived without a major sync) are the access
 * units in them estimated from the average access unit size; then
 * TRUEHD_ATMOS_BLOCK_INPUT_OFFSET_ESTIMATED is set on this and every later block until
 * reset(). The flag is also set when whole access units failed their checks and were counted
 * by their length fields alone. pts_au_index is exact under the same conditions as
 * input_access_unit.
 *
 * LAYOUT: layout_serial identifies the channel roles: sample rate, presentation, channel
 * count, and each channel's speaker code (and, for presentation 3, element kind, which
 * follows from the speaker code: bed/LFE vs object). It is constant for a stream and across
 * reset() on the same stream; it increments, with TRUEHD_ATMOS_BLOCK_LAYOUT_CHANGED on the
 * first block, only when those roles actually change (a different stream or configuration
 * after a splice or seek, a presentation switch). For presentation 3 the roles come from the
 * major sync and agree with the OAMD bed assignment, so metadata elements always match
 * block.speakers index for index; an OAMD payload stating a different element configuration
 * changes the roles (new serial) in the block where its first update starts.
